> **Mac client is always "waiting connect"**

1. please ensure mac and app are in the same wifi.
2. please ensure WoodPeckeriOS.framework was the latest version.
3. connect to mac client manually, long press your iOS app's screen with two fingers, you'll see the connection page, try search and connect to your mac client.
4. If it still doesn't work, <a href="/contact.html">click here</a>.

<br/>
> **I often connect to other's mac.**

 You could make some options to specify which client you'd like to connect, <a href="/connection.html">see advanced usage</a>.

<br/>
> **Xcode 10 Archive failed (i386 bitcode problem)**

1. please use the device arch only framework <a href="/assets/framework/WoodPeckeriOS_device.framework.zip">WoodPeckeriOS_device.framework</a>, it's full bitcode enabled. But I would suggest you use the full version above in most situations.
